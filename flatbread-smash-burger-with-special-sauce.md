# 🗓️ Flatbread Smash Burger Prep & Storage Plan

## 🫓 Flatbreads

---

## 🧄 Special Sauce

* **Make Ahead**: Whisk and store in a jar.

---

## 🥩 Smash Burger Patties

* **Prep**: Divide ground beef into balls, lightly press, place on a tray lined with parchment.
* **Fridge**: Cover tightly, keep up to **24 hours** before cooking.

2. **At Dinner Time (15 minutes)**:

   * Warm flatbreads.

   * Reheat onions.
   * Assemble with sauce + fresh toppings.

👉 This way, you only need **10–15 minutes of cooking** on burger night.

Great question — a **flatbread smash burger** can definitely be lightened up while still tasting amazing. Here are some practical ways to make it healthier, broken down by each component:

---

## 🫓 Flatbread

* **Switch to whole wheat flour** or mix half whole wheat, half all-purpose to boost fiber.
* Use **less oil/butter** in the dough or replace with Greek yogurt for a lighter version.
* Make smaller flatbreads (6-inch instead of 8-inch) to reduce portion size.

---

## 🥩 Burger Patty

* Use **lean ground beef (90/10)** instead of 80/20 → less fat, still flavorful.
* Swap for **ground turkey, chicken, or bison** for a lighter, protein-rich patty.
* Try a **plant-based option**: lentil patties, black bean burgers, or falafel-style patties.

---

## 🧄 Special Sauce

* Use **light mayo or Greek yogurt** instead of full mayo.
* Cut ketchup in half or use a no-sugar-added ketchup.
* Add more yogurt + lemon juice for tang, less fat overall.

---

## 🧅 Onions & Toppings

* Caramelize onions in a **nonstick pan with a splash of water**, not butter, to cut fat.
* Load up on **fresh veggies**: lettuce, tomato, cucumber, arugula, even shredded carrot.
* Use **avocado slices** instead of cheese for creaminess (healthy fats).

---

## 🧀 Cheese

* Use **reduced-fat cheese** or skip altogether if you like.
* A thin slice of strong cheese (like sharp cheddar) gives flavor with less quantity.

---

## ⚡ Cooking & Assembly

* Smash the patties thin but keep them small → less meat per burger, but still crispy.
* Serve **open-faced** (use one flatbread folded in half) instead of two stacked.
* Pair with a **side salad or roasted veggies** instead of fries.

---

### ✅ Example: Healthier Flatbread Smash Burger

* Whole wheat yogurt flatbread
* Lean ground turkey patty
* Greek-yogurt based sauce with garlic + lemon
* Plenty of crunchy veggies (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, arugula)
* Just a sprinkle of cheese or none at all

This way, you cut calories, fat, and carbs while **adding fiber, protein, and micronutrients**.

Would you like me to **recalculate the nutrition** for a “healthier version” (using lean beef/turkey, whole wheat flatbread, lighter sauce)?
